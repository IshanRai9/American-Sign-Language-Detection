Small project I worked on with the intention of expanding it to a fully developed application.
This project is based on the video by Computer Vision Engineer, I highly suggest everyone to watch the video at least once to get a simple and clear understanding of the code.

### ‚ö†Ô∏èNOTE: Two models and pickle files have been given, model.p and data.pickle have been trained by a small dataset of 30mb which includes numbers while the model2.p and data2.pickle have been trained using a large dataset of 1gb+ which includes special signs like delete, nothing and space.

<h1>‚≠êTLDR:</h1>

* The data gets loaded and the landmarks of the hand symbol are stored in a picke file
* The model is trained using 80% of the pickle file and tested with the remaining 20%
* The main function occurs in inference_classifier.py where you map the alphanumerics with a number for the model to classify.


<h2>üíª Built with:</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*   Pickle.py
*   MediaPipe
*   cv2
*   sklearn
*   numpy
*   Dataset used from Kaggle
